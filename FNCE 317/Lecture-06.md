### Net Present Value [NPV]
- what is npv? -> difference in market value of the project vs cost
- What makes good decision criteria?
- adjust for time value of money? if it does, yes 👍
- adjust for risk? if it does, yes 👍
- create value for firm? if it does, yes 👍

#### Decision Rule
if its positive 📈, take ✅. if negative 📉, then don't 👿

#### Payback Rule
payback rule evaluates a project by calculating the payback period, the time it takes to recover the initial investment from cash inflows

- pros:
- **Simple**: Easy to calculate and understand.
- **Liquidity-focused**: Emphasizes quick recovery of investment.
- **Risk indicator**: Shorter payback periods suggest lower risk.
- cons: 
- **Ignores time value of money**: Does not discount future cash flows.
- **Overlooks later cash flows**: Ignores profits after the payback period.
- **Arbitrary cutoff**: The cutoff period is subjective and may lead to poor decisions.
- **No value creation insight**: Does not directly measure if the project adds value to the firm.
