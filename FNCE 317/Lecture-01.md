## Chapter 2 [Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes]
 
### Statement of Financial Position
 - aka The Balance Sheet [*basics* yk 😭]
 - Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity [at a specific time]

```
 Assets | Liabilities			[In order
    -   | Shareholders Equity		 	 of
 	|					    Liquidity]
```
 - Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities [🤧]
 
### Liquidity
 - how easily something can be turned into **cash** without **losing much value***
 
### Value vs Cost
 - book value = **OG** cost [goated asf 🫡👍]; market value = cost based on *whats up in the market/economy*
 - Market value is usually *more important* for decision-making because it reflects the current worth.
 - Book value requires much less work so it was used widely till recently [if it ain't broke, don't fix it bruh, fk market value 😭😭]
 
### International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS]
 - allows companies to use **historical cost method** 👍 [im guessing the book value thing, right?]
 - also allows **revaluation (aka fair value) method** [sounds shit because you have to regularly keep updating it to keep consistency 🤡]
 
### Statement of Comprehensive Income
 - revenues - expenses [over a period of time, such as a quarter of a year]
 - matching principle! to show the revenue, u must deduct the expenses that were required to generate the revenue [like a normal person, *ts ain't hard to understand* 💔🥀]
 - go to http://www.sedar.com/ if u wanna look at some company's statement
 
### Cash Flows
 - derived from financial statements, tells how *cash is generated* [ofc 😮‍💨]
 - Cash Flow From Assets (CFFA) = Cash Flow to Bondholders + Cash Flow to Shareholders
 - Cash Flow From Assets = Operating Cash Flow – Net Capital Spending – Changes in NWC

### Taxes
 - Individual taxes [u pay those lil bro 💔]
 - Corporate taxes [elon musk probably pays these for twitter]
 - Marginal Tax Rate: tax rate you **pay** on your **next dollar of income**

```
Example: "Picture this: You’re making $40,000, fantastic. The tax guy says, “First $30,000, I take 10%, okay? But anything over that, I’m taking 20%, believe me.” So, if you make one more dollar, that dollar gets taxed at 20%. That’s your marginal rate—the tax on the extra cash. It’s like the price of winning more!"
```
 - Average Tax Rate: the *overall tax* rate you **pay** on your **total income**

```
Example: "You make $40,000, and you pay $3,000 on the first $30,000 (10%) and $2,000 on the next $10,000 (20%). Total tax is $5,000. Divide that by $40,000, and boom, your average rate is 12.5%. It’s like the average score of a terrific deal."
```
- To Put it simply, Marginal = Tax on the next buck you make; Average = Total tax divided by total money

### Taxes on Investments
 - you invest in stocks, u gotta *pay taxes* on what you *earn*
 - Dividend tax [canadians get dividend tax credit to lower the tax you owe on these dividends, prevents double taxation]
 - Capital gain tax [paid on the profit when you sell a stock for more than you bought it 📈]

#### Capital Cost Allowance [CCA]
 - depreciation for tax purposes
 - deducted **before taxes**, acts like a tax shield 🛡️
 - the *more* the **CCA**, the *lesser tax* you **pay** on the asset
 - different percentages for different assets, see image below

- Additional concept: Group assets in asset classes [like multiple computers]; when one asset sold, reduce value of asset class [subtract book value or realized value of asset sold, whichever is lesser]
- Closing asset class? When last asset in a class is sold, asset class is terminated. Leads to: terminal loss or recaptured CCA
- Terminal Loss - Happens if the asset’s book value (Undepreciated Capital Cost, or UCC) is **higher** than what you sell it for (adjusted cost)
- Recaptured CCA: Happens if the UCC is **lower** than the sale price (adjusted cost)
