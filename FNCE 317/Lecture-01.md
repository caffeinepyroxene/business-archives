## Chapter 2 [Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes]
 
### Statement of Financial Position
 - aka The Balance Sheet [*basics* yk 😭]
 - Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity [at a specific time]

```
 Assets | Liabilities			[In order
    -   | Shareholders Equity		 	 of
 	|					    Liquidity]
```
 - Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities [🤧]
 
### Liquidity
 - how easily something can be turned into **cash** without **losing much value***
 
### Value vs Cost
 - book value = **OG** cost [goated asf 🫡👍]; market value = cost based on *whats up in the market/economy*
 - Market value is usually *more important* for decision-making because it reflects the current worth.
 - Book value requires much less work so it was used widely till recently [if it ain't broke, don't fix it bruh, fk market value 😭😭]
 
### International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS]
 - allows companies to use **historical cost method** 👍 [im guessing the book value thing, right?]
 - also allows **revaluation (aka fair value) method** [sounds shit because you have to regularly keep updating it to keep consistency 🤡]
 
### Statement of Comprehensive Income
 - revenues - expenses [over a period of time, such as a quarter of a year]
 - matching principle! to show the revenue, u must deduct the expenses that were required to generate the revenue [like a normal person, *ts ain't hard to understand* 💔🥀]
 - go to http://www.sedar.com/ if u wanna look at some company's statement
 
### Cash Flows
 - derived from financial statements, tells how *cash is generated* [ofc 😮‍💨]
 - Cash Flow From Assets (CFFA) = Cash Flow to Bondholders + Cash Flow to Shareholders
 - Cash Flow From Assets = Operating Cash Flow – Net Capital Spending – Changes in NWC
