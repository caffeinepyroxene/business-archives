### To Do:
- Get a Financial Calc [i forgor today ðŸ˜”ðŸ¥€]

### Future Value / Computing
- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value
- R (i/y) =  Interest Rate
- N (t) = Time [number of periods]
```math
FV = PV(1+r)^t
```
- Effect of compunding -> small for **less periods**; larger for **more periods**

### Present Value / Discounting
```math
PV = FV/(1+r)^t
```
- For given interest rate -> **longer** time period = **lower** present value
- For given time period -> **higher** interest rate = **smaller** present value

### Discount Rate
- r = [(FV/PV)^(1/t)] - 1

### Number of Periods
- t = ln(FV/PV)/ln(1+r)
