## Chapter 5 [Introduction to Valuation]

### To Do:
- [x] Get a Financial Calc [i forgor today 😔🥀]

### Future Value / Computing
- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value
- R (i/y) =  Interest Rate
- N (t) = Time [number of periods]
```math
FV = PV(1+r)^t
```
- Effect of compunding -> small for **less periods**; larger for **more periods**

### Present Value / Discounting
```math
PV = FV/(1+r)^t
```
- For given interest rate -> **longer** time period = **lower** present value
- For given time period -> **higher** interest rate = **smaller** present value

### Discount Rate
- r = [(FV/PV)^(1/t)] - 1

### Number of Periods
- t = ln(FV/PV)/ln(1+r)

## Chapter 1 [Introduction to Corporate Finance]

### Corporate Finance
- area in finance that deals with how companies manage financial resources to maximize value 📈
- Top Financial Manager **CFO** = Chief Financial Officer
- Others: Treasurer, Controller
- Captial budgeting = long-term investments
- Capital Structure = mix of debt, equity that company **uses** for *finance operations, investments or growth*
- Working Capital Management = management of short term assets, liabilities

### Types of Business Organizations
#### Sole proprietorship [single owner]
- pros: easy to start, less regulation, owner keeps all 💰, taxxed once
- cons: owner liable for everything, can invest only owner's equity
  
#### Partnership [2 or more owners]
- pros: easy to start, more capital, income taxxed as personal income 
- cons: liable for everything (even the partner), disagreements

#### Corporation [legal entity, publicaly traded]
- pros: limited liability, runs forever, easier to raise capital (with stocks, bonds, etc)
- cons: seperation of ownership and management, double taxxation

#### Income Trust [hold debt/equity and distribute income to unit holders]
- pros: not subject to corporate income tax, more tax efficient
- cons: not a corporation

#### Co-operative [owned by members]
- pros: <didnt get it>
- cons: difficult to make decisions

### Goals

### Agency Problem
- Agency? Shareholders **hire** managers to run company
- Problem? **conflicts** of interest exit between those two 😡
- Costs: agency costs [direct and indirect]

### Social Responsibility/Ethical Investing
