- [ ] Quick Quiz (part 4)

### Future and Present Values of Multiple Cash Flows
~ Just do the examples from notes 💔🥀

#### PV Example - Multiple Cash Flows [6-11]
- 1st year (t = 1): $200
- 2nd year (t = 2): $400
- 3rd year (t = 3): $600
- 4th year (t = 4) = $800
- r: 12%
- Method 1: *convert* all of them to **PV** (year 0) and **add** them
- PV = FV/(1+r)^t
- Method 2: use calc **CF** function 🤓

#### PV Example - Multiple Cash Flows [6-16]
- t = 1 : $1k
- t = 2 : $2k
- t = 3 : $3k
- r = 10%
- Calculate PVs and probably add them like last question 👍

#### PV Example - Multiple Cash Flows [6-21]
- confusing asf 😩

### Annuities
- **equal** payments at **equal** intervals

#### Growing Annuity
- **limited** number of growing cash flows

### Perpetuities
- **infinite** series of **equal*8 payments
- PV = C/r

#### Growing Perpetuities
- cash flows grow at constant rate **forever**

### Effective Annual Rate [EAR]
- actual annual interest rate that accounts for the effect of compounding over a year

### Annual Percentage Rate [APR]
- annual rate that is quoted by law
- period rate times the number of periods per year
- Period rate = APR/number of periods per year
- APR to EAR:
